# Lazy Fortran delivery status

## Active milestone

M3 — bounded C1106 semantic-oracle slice; full Core 0 remains pending

## Central goal

Progress through the cross-repository delivery path from normative source to
an executable compiler observable:

```text
normative source fact
→ standard-new artifact
→ frontend contract
→ StandardIR
→ downstream contract
→ deterministic observable
```

The result must have an independent oracle. This remains a bounded delivery
target, not a claim that the complete standard or compiler is implemented. L2
is promoted; M1-M2 is promoted by its corrected central replay and focused
review. M3 is now open through one bounded C1106 delivery contract; the full
Core 0 semantic milestone remains unpromoted.

## Component pins

These are the clean component revisions currently pinned by the control plane.

## Historical milestone evidence

L0 was recorded as passed by `R000437`. The pinned
`standard-new/specs/lexical-facts-v0.sx` source regenerated a deterministic
canonical SX output and generated schema artifact. The reviewed golden and
independent oracle passed; the malformed neighbor produced `unclosed SX list`;
the source-hash mutation was rejected by the oracle. See
`artifacts/traces/l0-lexical-slice-v0.json`.

L1 was recorded as passed by `R000438`. The pinned `standard-new`
canonicalized the two-rule StandardIR grammar fixture and the pinned
`fortfront-new` grammar frontier accepted `PROGRAM` and rejected `BAD`; the
malformed StandardIR neighbor and independent oracle passed. See
`artifacts/traces/l1-frontend-slice-v0.json`. This remains historical evidence,
not current promotion evidence.

## Current verification state

- L0: `PASS`. The corrected component-local boundary replay, independent
  oracle, clean-build/toolchain checks, deterministic outputs, committed trace
  comparison, and all four independent Luna reviews pass. The v2 reports are
  retained historical evidence; the v3 reports are the active review evidence.
- L1: `PASS`. The corrected replay and all four independent Luna reviews pass;
  v1 reports retain the two repaired review failures and v2 reports are the
  active evidence.
- L2: `PASS`; the corrected bounded central execution gate is `PASS` in
  `R000441`. The first fresh review wave is retained as `R000442`; three lanes
  passed and the oracle lane found that recorded tool/runtime pins were not
  consumed as the evidence authority. The runner and oracle now consume those
  pins and the runtime expectation. The next review wave, `R000443`, found
  stale state wording, an unvalidated runtime-oracle identity, and an
  incomplete reproducibility trace. Those corrections are committed in
  the current clean checkout; its central gate passes and three valid focused
  Luna scopes pass in `R000444`. The promotion reports are retained under
  `artifacts/reports/L2/replay-v4-luna-*.md`.
- M1-M2: `PASS`. The source-backed gate passes in corrected replay `R000454`
  from pushed commit `cf84423`; `R000450` remains the exact payload authority.
  The fixture, regression corpus, trace, environment record and failed review
  history are retained under `artifacts/` and `research/runs/2026-08.jsonl`.
  Focused integration review `R000455` passes; no source, grammar or oracle
  defect remains open.
- E0174: the source-node-aware correspondence replay passes in cold run
  `R000467`; fast reuse control `R000468` completes in 7.84 seconds with
  exact cache, log, environment and output-hash checks. These runs do not
  claim target insertion or semantic promotion. The focused independent
  reviews pass at central revision `572ed6c`.
- E0172 remains abandoned before its model cell: R000456 found that the
  endpoint exposed Qwen 3.8 27B while the experiment declared Qwen 3.6
  35B-A3B. No model output was accepted. E0174 is closed.
- M3 is `OPEN` through `T-M3-c1106-semantic-oracle`. D0124 and D0125 select
  the source-backed C1106 associate-construct-name relation with ASCII
  case-insensitive identity. The exact gate is
  `tests/e2e/run-m3-c1106.sh .cache/runs/E0175/R000474`; its mechanical replay
  and focused promotion review `R000476` pass. The bounded slice is promoted;
  no model output is promoted and the full Core 0 milestone remains open.

The L0 runner currently consumes `standard-new/specs/lexical-facts-v0.sx`
and the component's `specs/schema-v0.sxs` generator fixture. It is now
explicitly classified as a component-local generator boundary, not as a
consumer of central `contracts/standardir-v0.sxs`; the accepted D0022
decision says that local schema is not the complete StandardIR contract. The
recorded L1 run predates the commit containing its final central inputs; the
current replay supersedes it for promotion purposes. L2's active claim is
limited to the pinned `frontend-v0` witness → canonical `mir-v0` SX → bounded
RV64 Linux ELF → QEMU exit status and independent code-word checks. It does
not claim source parsing, StandardIR conversion, or serialized TargetIR and
emission contract interchange.

## Active fixture

ID: `T-M3-c1106-semantic-oracle` — bounded source-backed C1106 semantic
oracle; central replay `R000474` and focused review `R000476` pass; the bounded
slice is promoted and full M3 remains open.

Boundary decisions: `research/decisions/D0124-first-m3-associate-name-oracle.md`
and `research/decisions/D0125-m3-c1106-case-insensitive-names.md`.

Expected observable: a typed associate-construct-name pair whose deterministic
oracle returns `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED` or `UNRESOLVED`, bound to C1106 and the
R1102/R1103/R1106 StandardIR rows, with positive, negative, unknown and source
mutation controls. The outcome inventory is generated by
`tests/e2e/run-m3-c1106.sh .cache/runs/E0175/R000474`.

Oracle: `tests/e2e/validate_m3_c1106.py`, which computes the outcome from the
typed facts independently of the expected labels. Model output cannot promote
a fact.

## Active task

ID: `T-M3-c1106-semantic-oracle` — E0175 C1106 source-backed semantic-oracle
vertical slice.

Verifier: `tests/e2e/run-m3-c1106.sh .cache/runs/E0175/R000474` from clean
central and component checkouts. It includes the standard-new semantic-items
canonicalization, source/provenance checks, the independent oracle, mutation
controls, exact trace comparison and zero model/promotion counters.

## Current blocker

The L2 boundary and M1-M2 source-backed fixture are promoted. The D0119
correspondence replay verifier passes in E0174/R000467, with fast iteration
control R000468 and both focused independent reviews passing. D0084 keeps
the broad semantic/model lane closed while the bounded M3 contract is
verified. E0172's runtime identity failure is retained as R000456. The
central C1106 replay R000474 and focused review R000476 pass. The remaining
blocker is full M3/Core 0, which requires a separately defined bounded
contract; a green slice does not close full M3.

## Next executable task

The bounded slice is promoted. The next action is to define one separate,
source-backed M3 contract over an already represented shape before broadening.
Do not resume E0172, start broad parsing/semantic work, or promote a model
fact. Do not treat this bounded slice as the full M3 milestone.

## Last verified central command

```text
Current L0 replay and four-lane review: PASS.
Current L1 replay and four-lane review: PASS.
Current L2: corrected central execution gate `R000441` `PASS`; focused
promotion review `R000444` `PASS`; L2 is promoted. M1-M2 corrected replay
`R000454` and focused integration review `R000455` are `PASS`; the
current active replay `scripts/verify_active_milestone.sh` also passes at
central commit `bdb8717`. The M3 C1106 central replay `R000474` and focused
review `R000476` are `PASS`; the bounded slice is promoted and full M3 remains
open.
```

## Blacklisted pseudo-progress

- Component-local success reported as integration success.
- New contracts or provenance fields not consumed by the central fixture.
- Generated code compiling treated as normative or semantic correctness.
- Unpinned sibling artifacts.
- A second fixture family before the first reaches its final observable.
